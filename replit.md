## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
- **Pure client-side application**: No backend server required
- **Single-page application (SPA)**: All functionality contained in one HTML file
- **Component-based JavaScript**: Object-oriented approach using ES6 classes
- **Responsive design**: Mobile-first approach with CSS Grid and Flexbox

### Technology Stack
- **HTML5**: Semantic markup with accessibility features
- **CSS3**: Custom properties (CSS variables) for theming, modern layout techniques
- **Vanilla JavaScript**: ES6+ features, no frameworks
- **GSAP**: Animation library for smooth transitions and effects

## Key Components

### 1. Image Upload System
- **File input**: Multiple image selection with `accept="image/*"`
- **Visual upload button**: Custom styled label with icon
- **File validation**: Client-side image type checking
- **Preview generation**: Creates thumbnails using FileReader API

### 2. Gallery Display
- **Grid layout**: CSS Grid for responsive image arrangement
- **Image cards**: Hover effects and smooth transitions
- **Empty state**: User-friendly message when no images are uploaded
- **Dynamic content**: Images rendered via JavaScript DOM manipulation

### 3. Modal/Lightbox System
- **Full-screen image viewer**: Modal overlay for detailed image viewing
- **Navigation controls**: Previous/next image browsing
- **Keyboard accessibility**: ESC key to close, arrow keys for navigation
- **File information display**: Shows filename and metadata

### 4. Animation System
- **GSAP integration**: Professional-grade animation library
- **Timeline animations**: Coordinated entrance effects
- **Micro-interactions**: Hover effects, button animations
- **Performance optimized**: Hardware-accelerated transforms

## Data Flow

1. **Image Upload**:
   - User selects files via input or drag-and-drop
   - Files validated and processed by FileReader
   - Thumbnails generated and added to gallery array
   - DOM updated with new image elements

2. **Gallery Rendering**:
   - Images stored in JavaScript array
   - Grid dynamically populated with image cards
   - Each card includes thumbnail, filename, and metadata
   - Animations applied to new elements

3. **Modal Interaction**:
   - Click on gallery image opens modal
   - Full-size image loaded and displayed
   - Navigation between images updates modal content
   - Close action returns to gallery view

## External Dependencies

### CDN Resources
- **GSAP**: `https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/gsap/3.12.2/gsap.min.js`
  - Used for smooth animations and transitions
  - Provides timeline-based animation sequencing

### Asset Requirements
- **Icons**: SVG icons for upload and close buttons
- **Images**: Placeholder for empty states (optional)

## Deployment Strategy

### Static Hosting
- **No server required**: Pure client-side application
- **Any static host**: Can be deployed to Netlify, Vercel, GitHub Pages, etc.
- **CDN friendly**: All assets can be cached effectively

### Browser Compatibility
- **Modern browsers**: Requires ES6+ support
- **File API**: Needs FileReader and File API support
- **CSS Grid**: Requires modern CSS layout support

### Performance Considerations
- **Image optimization**: Client-side resizing for thumbnails
- **Lazy loading**: Images loaded as needed
- **Animation performance**: Hardware-accelerated CSS transforms
- **Memory management**: Proper cleanup of file objects

## Development Notes

### Code Organization
- **Modular structure**: Single class handles all functionality
- **Event-driven**: Uses event listeners for user interactions
- **Separation of concerns**: CSS for styling, JS for behavior
- **Accessibility**: ARIA labels and keyboard navigation

### Styling Approach
- **CSS Custom Properties**: Consistent theming system
- **Dark theme**: Modern dark UI with purple/teal accents
- **Responsive design**: Mobile-first with fluid typography
- **Animation ready**: Smooth transitions throughout

### Future Enhancements
- **Local storage**: Persist uploaded images between sessions
- **Image editing**: Basic crop/resize functionality
- **Drag and drop**: Enhanced upload experience
- **Social sharing**: Share images to social platforms
